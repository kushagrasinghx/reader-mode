# 📰 Reader Mode by Kushagra Singh

Reader Mode is a clean and distraction-free Chrome Extension that extracts the main content from webpages (like Safari's reading mode) using Mozilla’s Readability library and displays it in a beautifully styled interface with dark mode enabled by default.

## 🔧 Features

- ✨ Extracts article content from any webpage
- 🎨 Clean and minimal interface with **Noto Serif** typography
- 🌙 Dark Mode with toggle support

## 🛠 How it Works

- When you click the extension icon, the content script extracts the page's article using Readability.
- It then opens a new tab with `reader.html` and displays the content in a minimal layout.
- The layout applies has a clean look and strips away any visual clutter.
